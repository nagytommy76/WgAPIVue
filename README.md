# Wargaming API project with Vue.js

```
In this application I'm using the [Wargaming API](https://developers.wargaming.net/),
my goal is to learn the basic fundamentals of Vue.js.
The application is mobile friendly, but some function is not available in mobile devices.
```

## App abilities:
* You can login to the app, with Your WG account. If You're logged in:
    * You can see your battle statics, with different vehicles, if You ever played with it.
* Search for different players
* Search for vehicles, by nation, type (e.g. heavy tank, light) and tier
    * If you hover over a tank, Yo can see your statics with it. (If You're logged in)
